Throughout this course, we built an MS paint clone, a 3D shape tesselator, a scene file parser, and a ray tracer. 
As our final project, we extended the ray tracer to support rendering glass (refraction) and metal (path tracing!), and we added support to render mesh files. 
Separately, we simulated the movement of cloth under gravity and wind and used our extended ray tracer to render the resulting animation.
This allowed us to piece everything together to create a surrealist scene inspired by Dal√≠'s [The Persistence of Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Persistence_of_Memory).
